/**
 * Sends www.<domain> to the bare <domain> with a 301.
 *
 * This is not only an SEO nicety. ASSET_URL is a single absolute origin
 * (https://claryeo.com), so a page served from www.claryeo.com requests its
 * Vite bundles cross-origin — and module scripts are fetched in CORS mode, so
 * the browser blocks every one of them with "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
 * header". The page renders unstyled and dead. Serving one canonical host is
 * what keeps assets same-origin; adding CORS headers to the asset origin would
 * paper over a split-brain we do not actually want.
 *
 * Deliberately host-shape based rather than comparing against APP_URL: it must
 * behave the same in every environment, and staging's canonical host differs.
